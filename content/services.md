## What we do
We run lean B2B operations that turn tools and ideas into results. Scope stays tight, timelines stay short, and reporting stays clean.

### Licensing & Subscriptions Operations
- Account provisioning and access hygiene
- Renewals calendar, vendor coordination, and negotiations
- Proof-of-purchase traceability (receipts, PO alignment)
- Monthly Annex: itemized tools, owners, usage notes, delta vs prior month  
Outcome: fewer surprises, one owner per tool, and a simple annex you can read in minutes.

### Automation & Integrations
- Workflow design with n8n/Make and lightweight glue code
- Approvals, notifications, and handoffs across apps you already use
- Data syncs to sheets/DBs for quick reporting
- AI-assisted ops for drafting, QA and triage (measured, not magic)  
Outcome: repeatable processes, fewer clicks, observable results.

### Performance Marketing & Analytics
- Slim testing plans and creative iteration cadence
- Campaign setup and housekeeping (naming, UTM, exclusions)
- Measurement with GA4 / Looker Studio dashboards
- Conversion-rate quick wins and landing checks  
Outcome: a small, honest funnel you can actually maintain.

### Design & Brand Systems
- Brand essentials (logo usage, color/typography tokens)
- Sales and campaign collateral, ad sets, and landing blocks
- Asset libraries with versioning and handover notes  
Outcome: consistent visuals, faster production, fewer re-makes.

### Reporting & Annex
- One-page status (goals, risks, next actions)
- Annex for costs, assets, links, and receipts
- Rolling log of decisions and changes  
Outcome: you always know what changed, why, and whats next.

## Ways to work
**Quick Sprint (412 weeks)**  Focused objective, fixed scope, visible outcome. Good for kick-offs or audits.  
**Lean Retainer (month to month)**  A steady lane for ops + automation + reporting. Flexible, capped hours, weekly check-ins.  
**Project Package**  Defined deliverables (e.g., tooling annex + renewals revamp + two automations + dashboard).
