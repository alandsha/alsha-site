- **Monthly Licensing Ops:** we manage tools & subscriptions, keep Annex + receipts, reconcile costs monthly.
- **Ops Automation:** recurring tasks turned into workflows (approvals, notifications, docs, storage).
- **Store-in-a-Week:** from zero to live basic store (POD/FBA/affiliates), with a minimal playbook.
- **Lean Campaigns:** simple funnel, fast creatives, tight reporting and iteration.
